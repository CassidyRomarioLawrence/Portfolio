        My name is Cassidy Lawrence, I'm currently 24-years of age. I
        matriculated in the year 2016 and the year after I worked in retail for
        a bit before I started my studies in Business Administration for 2
        years. During my final year I completed my practical at a organization
        by the name of DISABLED PEOPLE SOUTH AFRICA. This is where I got exposed
        to many things including technology, I then immediately fell in love
        with tech. The year after I studied Networking at College of Cape Town,
        I completed the course but I could tell this was not the route in the
        I.T field I want to be in so I did some research about all the
        possibilities and came across software development. I jumped straight
        into teaching myself how to code using platforms like google and
        YouTube. This is when I knew for sure this is my passion i then applied
        to LIfe Choices Academy and now I'm an official Aspiring Web Developer.
